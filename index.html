            How Obamacare was established and Trump's attempt to repeal Obamacare
        </h1>
        <p class="lead italic fs-4">
            Obamacare was signed by Obama on March 23, 2010. It has provided almost all Americans, especially those who
            are financially challenged, great health subsidies that no other Acts have offered before. Trump, however,
            is strongly against
            this act. Many believed that his root of hatred all started at the The annual Washington Post gala White
            House Correspondents’ Dinner ...

                Ever since Trump became the president of USA in 2017, he has been working towards repealing <span
                    class="fw-bold">Obamacare
                    (a.k.a: Affordable Care Act)</span> once and for all. One of many reasons that he is putting so much
                efforts to
                repeal
                this Act is that the ACA has made it compulsory for most Americans to purchase their own insurance. As
                a
                result of the ACA, most Americans would have to limit their weekly incomes just to pay for Medicare
                premiums.

                According to Trump's tweets between 2017 and and 2020, it is evident that he was very vocal about
                demolishing the act. However, not many medias or people supported his views and decisions, specially in
                2020, where the pandemic began (Dorning, M., Dennis, T. S., (2020, June)).

                        entirely negative. The tweets that have higher sentiment seem to focus on his achievements on
                        repealing Obamacare, whereas the others emphasize on how costly Obamacare was to Americans.

                bankruptcy, even for those with insurance. The economy where healthcare was among many factors that
                threatened to eat the budget alive was why Obama decided to establish the ACA scheme.

                The ACA scheme, also known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, required everyone to either have
                health insurance or pay a tax. This scheme aimed to provide steady medical supports to millions of
                people, especially those with pre-existing conditions by encouraging young and healthy people to get
                their own insurance.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 my-4">
                According to the sentiment scores of Obama's tweets on Obamacare, it appears that he'd written more
                negative sentimental tweets than positive. Those that are positive often expressed how successful
                Obamacare was to Americans, whereas the latter emphasized on how many couldn't afford the care they
                need.

                This shows that Obama had put a lot thoughts and considerations when designing this scheme, and that
                he's working hard to ensure everyone gets the medical support they need.

            <h1>6. What would happen if Trump were to repeal Obamacare?</h1>
            <p class="fs-5 my-4">If Obamacare were to be repealed, at least 12.3 million Americans would lose their
                insurance because it is not mandatory anymore (Saltzman, E., & Eibner, C. (2015)). This would cause an
                increase of 8% in market premiums in 2017 and even more today, especially during the pandemic. The
                increase of premiums would then cause significant coverage losses to many other Americans.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 my-4">In short, by demolishing the ACA, millions of people would be "kicked" out of
                insurance. Losing insurance would mean losing health benefits and getting much higher medical costs.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 my-4">The ACA, or Obamacare, has become so popular today than it was when it first passed in
                2010. Yet, neither the Republicans nor Trump have proposed any alternative without ensuring the same
                protection for the people.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Conclusion-->
        <div class="my-5">
            <h1>7. Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="fs-5 my-4">In conclusion, the ACA has helped not only providing subsidies to almost all Americans,
                but also slowing down the rise in medical costs. However, it can be viewed negatively by the fact that
                it mandates everyone to get their own insurance. This is also one of the reasons, besides the hatred for
                Obama, that Trump is so opposed to this Act.</p>
            <p class="fs-5 my-4">Up until this date, Trump's effort to repeal Obamacare is still an ongoing process.
                Neither him nor his Republican party has yet to offer any alternative that could maintain the same
                coverage as Obamacare did for the Americans. This is very crucial because the need for insurance and
                medical coverage is highly important in 2020 and 2021, during the pandemic.</p>
